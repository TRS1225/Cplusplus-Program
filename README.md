# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-This program displays two separate clocks based on user input.

# What did you do particularly well?
-I would say the whole program was written efficiently, but in particular the switch statement with calls to functions were written with minimally confusing code.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-I could probably make the clock displays themselves a bit more minimal, side by side, and add more whitespace to make it more readable.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-The bit of code that was most difficult was writing the code to display the differences between the two clocks themselves, 12 hour vs 24 hour. I overcame this difficulty by incrementally trying new pieces of code until it worked. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-The parts of the code which utilized functions and their prototypes highlight skills and knowledge which will be useful in most programs that I am required to write in the future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-With incremental changes. Write a small amount of code, then compile and run. Rinse and repeat.
